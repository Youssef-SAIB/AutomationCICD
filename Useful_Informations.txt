Remark 1: Section22 | video 177 | 06:00 minute
	when a test fail =>  Example:  ErrorValidationTest->addProductErrorValidation()
	then @AfterMethod lunched so the driver it killed 
	then the testNG Listener call method 'onTestFailure()'
	inside 'onTestFailure()' we call 'getScreenShot' method where we use 'driver' , but at this moment the driver is killed (driver=null)
	So 'getScreenShot' method failed -then- 'onTestFailure()' failed -then- all the rest of method(@Test) in ErrorValidationTest(class) stop running
	Solution : Add 'WebDriver driver' to  'getScreenShot()' method


Remark 2 : Section22 | video 177 |
	we should always add <listeners> <listener class-name="WebAutomation.TestComponents.Listeners"/> </listeners> to suite.xml file 
	If not , TestNG will not consider those listener method when running tests
	

Remark 3 : Section22 | video 178 | 00:00 minute
	when we run suite.xml in parallel mode , all test running in parallel use the same ExtentTest object (testReport)
	Solution : use ThreadLocal class in 'Listener' => for every ExtentTest initiated (testReport) for a method(@Test) we put it in the ThreadLocal (.set(..))
			   then whenever we want to use this ExtentTest (testReport) [example in "onTestFailure()"] we call it from the ThreadLocal (.get(..)) 
			   So this initiated ExtentTest (testReport) will not be used with other method(@Test) 
			   

Remark 4 : Section22 | video 179 | 00:00 minute | title: flaky test
	when we run a test and it failed, maybe we want to retest it one more time, so we are sure that is a real fail
	we can add the 'Retry' class which implements IRetryAnalyzer interface to our Selenium Framework
	to make a test retry one more time when it fail, we should add "retryAnalyze=Retry.class" to the method(@Test)
	How retry() method work:  to run one more time the failed test the method retry() should return true
	Sequence : when test fail -> execute retry() in Retry class -> if test still failing execute onTestFailure() in Listeners class 
	 
	I have failed to use retry with ErroValidationTest->addProductErrorValidation() method => "skip -then- pass" instead of "skip -then- fail"
	it's work well with ErroValidationTest->loginErrorValidation() method 
	

Remark 5 : Section23 | video 180 | 04:50 minute | title: run suite.xml from terminal using maven plugin
           cmd : mvn test -PRegression  (-P == Profil in pom.xml file) (Regression is the id of that profil)

Remark 6 : Section23 | video 181 | 00:00 minute | title: set Global parameters using maven commands
		   we can change dynamically Global parameter (in GlobalData.properties) using maven plugin (run with terminal)
		   Example change browser { chrome, firefox or edge, ..}
		   we add a condition in BaseTest class , to verify if we are receiving a value for browser from maven terminal to use it
		   if not we use the value from the file GlobalData.properties
		   cmd : mvn test -Dbrowser=firefox  (-D == maven parameters)
		   
Remark 7 : Section23 | video 184 | 00:00 minute | title: run tests in headless mode , 
		   add a condition to BaseTest to see if the value come from maven terminal and contain "headless" => run in headless
		   if not run with normal browser (from GlobalData.properties) 
		   we should add an instruction to be sure that the browser in headless mode is running in maximize mode (see BaseTest)
		   
Remark 8 : Run jenkins windows , we should execute command in cmd as Admin
		   cmd : C:\Windows\System32>net start jenkins  | ... net stop jenkins
		   Run jenkins.war , execute the next command in cmd 
		   cmd : java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9090
			

Remark 9 : Section25 | video 195 | 06:50 minute | title: Cucumber
		   we can use "tidy gherkin" extension for google chrome to generate step definition..
